Joint evaluation of the CMIP6 downscaling within EURO-CORDEX.


## Data Exchange

Some storage space on the existing jsc-cordex data exchange infrastructure at JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) is available and may be used to provide some intermediate, temporary, limited storage for the first joint analyses publications of CORDEX-CMIP6 simulations before data will be stored longer-term on ESGF-related storage at the respective centres. 

Access to storate at JSC is decribed [here](https://github.com/euro-cordex/jsc-cordex) (private repo).
