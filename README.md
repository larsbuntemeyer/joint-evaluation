# Joint evaluation
Joint evaluation of the CMIP6 downscaling within EURO-CORDEX.

This repository is supposed to help in organizing the EURO-CORDEX joint evaluation, e.g., it holds meta data like tables, and catalogs, but also README files and [issues](https://github.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation/issues) regarding evaluation. If you have any topics, questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to [open a new issue](https://github.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation/issues/new)! There is also the possibility to [join a team](https://github.com/orgs/euro-cordex/teams) to stay in touch easily if you want.

For a broader overview, you can also have a look at the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/euro-cordex/projects/5).

There is also a repository ([evaltools](https://github.com/euro-cordex/evaltools)) that might hold useful code used in the evaluation analysis. This is separated for better maintainability.

## Data exchange
Some storage space on the existing jsc-cordex data exchange infrastructure at JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) is available and may be used to provide some intermediate, temporary, limited storage for the first joint analyses publications of CORDEX-CMIP6 simulations before data will be stored longer-term on ESGF-related storage at the respective centres.

Access to storate at JSC is decribed [here](https://github.com/euro-cordex/jsc-cordex) (private repo until this is released to the community).

The variables requested for this joint evaluation, along their corresponding metadata, are available in this repository, under the file [dreq_EUR_joint_evaluation.csv](./dreq_EUR_joint_evaluation.csv). This file can be explored using the search box in Github; e.g. search for "Overview" to filter the variables currently requested for the overview evaluation work. This file can also be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation/refs/heads/main/dreq_EUR_joint_evaluation.csv), to use it in your data uploading scripts.

```python
import pandas as pd

pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation/refs/heads/main/dreq_EUR_joint_evaluation.csv")

## Catalog
A catalog of available data at JSC-CORDEX is available from this repository. For example,
```python
import intake

cat = intake.open_esm_datastore("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euro-cordex/joint-evaluation/refs/heads/main/CORDEX-CMIP6.json")
cat.keys()
```
gives
```
['CORDEX.EUR-12.GERICS.ERA5.evaluation.r1i1p1f1.REMO2020.v1.mon.hurs.v20240529',
 'CORDEX.EUR-12.GERICS.ERA5.evaluation.r1i1p1f1.REMO2020.v1.mon.pr.v20240529',

```
You can filter and filter and load datasets using, e.g.,:
```python
dataset_dict = cat.search(variable_id=["tas", "orog", "sftlf"]).to_dataset_dict()
```
and you will get a dictionary of datasets back. Note that this, for now, will only work when you are logged in to `jsc-cordex` since datasets reside on the local filesystem. For more info about `intake-esm`, please also see the [documentation](https://intake-esm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to/understand-keys-and-how-to-change-them.html).

## Starting Jupyter Lab

If you want to work interactively on jsc-cordex, you can use jupyterlab via ssh (right now, jsc-cordex is not available from [Jupyter-JSC](https://jupyter.jsc.fz-juelich.de)).
> [!NOTE]
> You need to activate a virtual environemt, e.g., using `conda activate base`, or any other environment in which you have installed your requirements including `conda install juypterlab`. The current base environment only contains some basic requirements, usually, you might want to setup a dedicated environment for yourself. Please consult the [README](https://github.com/euro-cordex/jsc-cordex?tab=readme-ov-file#conda).

Once you are logged in to jsc-cordex and set up, you can start the jupyter server (without a browser) like this:
```
jupyter lab --no-browser
```
Note the port in the URL, e.g. `http://localhost:8888` (the port can be different if several servers are running) and start an ssh tunnel with port forwarding on your local computer:
```
ssh -N -L 8000:localhost:8888 jsc-cordex
```
The jupyterlab should then be available in your local browser at `https://localhost:8000/`. The login token can also be found in the URL on the jsc-terminal. Please don't forget to kill your server once you are finished. It will be killed automatically if you close the terminal in which you started the server.
